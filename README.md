# How to Contribute
I put this project on Github as an experiment, and because Github is an awesome platform for collaboration. There is no computer code (at all) in this repository, if you want to help design this game and can write English you now have an excuse to contribute to a Github repository!

Contributors should familiarize themselves with how Github works. The help pages are pretty great.
